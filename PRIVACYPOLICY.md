# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to WikiBeta! This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our application. WikiBeta is designed to be an unofficial, third-party client for browsing BetaWiki, providing a native viewing experience with offline capabilities. We value your privacy and are committed to transparency in how the app operates.

## Information Collection and Use

### No Data Collection

WikiBeta does not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal data, browsing history, or credentials. The app does not communicate with any servers controlled by the developer.

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

To provide its features, WikiBeta stores certain information directly and only on your local device. This data is never transmitted to us. This includes:

- **Cached Articles and Images:** To enable offline access and improve performance, the app saves a local copy of the articles and images you view.
- **Favourites/Watchlist:** Your list of favourited articles is saved on your device so you can easily access them.
- **Saved Credentials:** If you use the "Remember me" feature on the login page, your username and encrypted password are saved securely in the **Windows Credential Manager** on your device. This information is only used to automatically log you into BetaWiki and is never transmitted to us.
- **App Settings:** Your preferences, such as the concurrency limit for downloads, are stored locally on your device.

## Third-party services

When you use WikiBeta, the app communicates directly with the servers of the wiki you are browsing (`betawiki.net`). This is essential for the app to function. When this happens, the following information is sent to the wiki's servers, just as it would be if you were using a standard web browser:

- **Standard Request Data:** Your IP address and a User-Agent string identifying the app.
- **Browsing and Searching:** The titles of articles you search for or navigate to.
- **Login Credentials:** When you log in, your username and password are sent directly and securely to BetaWiki's servers for authentication. We do not intercept or view this information.

WikiBeta operates under the terms and policies of the services it connects to. You can review BetaWiki's privacy policy here: **https://betawiki.net/wiki/BetaWiki:Privacy_policy**

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
